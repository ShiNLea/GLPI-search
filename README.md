# GLPI Spec Tool

Because I'm lazy, and I have the gall to use a good cause as a terrible excuse to learn JS and HTML.

## Purpose

This app taps into GLPI's API endpoints, gets data based on the service tag of the laptop entered, and formats the data nicely into an HTML table, which can further be downloaded as a CSV file (WIP).

> This app was created by an employee of [Black Diamond Group](https://www.blackdiamondgroup.com/).
